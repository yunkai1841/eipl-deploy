    This model "explicitly" extracts positions from the image that are important to the task, such as the work object or arm position,

    The robot is able to generate robust motions in response to changes in object position and lighting.

        rec_dim (int): The dimension of the recurrent state in the LSTM cell.
        k_dim (int, optional): The dimension of the attention points.
        joint_dim (int, optional): The dimension of the joint angles.
        temperature (float, optional): The temperature parameter for the softmax function.
